# Q1: Write a python program to sort a dictionary by values.

    # a = {"a": 12,"b": 23,"c": 6,"d":91,"e":45}

    # a = sorted(a.values())

    # print(a)


# Q2: Write a python script to print a dictionary where the keys are between 1 and 15 and the values are square of keys.

# a = {}

# for i in range(1,16):
#     a[i] = i*i # or i**2

# print(a)


# Q3: Write a program to multiply all the items in a dictionary.


# a = {"a": 1,"c": 2,"b": 3,"d":4,"e":5}

# product = 1

# for i in a :
#     product = product * a[i]

# print(product)


# Q4: Write a python program to sort keys.
