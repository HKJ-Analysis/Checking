# Exercise 1: Reverse the tuple

    # tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40, 50)
    # tuple1=tuple1[::-1]
    # print(tuple1)


# Example 2: The given tuple is a nested tuple. write a Python program to print the value 20.

    # tuple1 = ("Orange", [10, 20, 30], (5, 15, 25))
    # print(tuple1[1][1])


# Exercise 3: Create a tuple with single item 50

# tuple1 = (50,)
# print(tuple1)



# Example 4: Write a program to unpack the following tuple into four variables and display each variable.


# tuple1 = (10, 20, 30, 40)
# print(tuple1[0])
# print(tuple1[1])
# print(tuple1[2])
# print(tuple1[3])


# Exercise 5: Swap two tuples in Python

# tuple1 = (11, 22)
# tuple2 = (99, 88)

# # c=tuple1
# # tuple1=tuple2
# # tuple2=c

# tuple1 , tuple2 = tuple2 , tuple1

# print("tuple 1:",tuple1)
# print("tuple 2:",tuple2)


# Example 6:Write a program to copy elements 44 and 55 from the following tuple into a new tuple.


# tuple1 = (11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66)

# # tuple2=(tuple1[3],tuple1[4])

# tuple2 = tuple1[3:5]

# print("tuple2:",tuple2)



# Example 7: Given is a nested tuple. Write a program to modify the first item (22) of a list inside a following tuple to 222

# tuple1 = (11, [22, 33], 44, 55)
# tuple1[1][0] = 222
# print(tuple1)


# Exercise 9: Counts the number of occurrences of item 50 from a tuple

# tuple1 = (50, 10, 60, 70, 50)

# print(tuple1.count(50))
